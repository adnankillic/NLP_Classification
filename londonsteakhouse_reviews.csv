We were served by Yadira, who helped make our visit special, the service was outstanding, the food equally.  We ate off the fixed menu with cocktail...provided and consider this to be very good value for money.  We had the house Merlot with the main course and this to was excellent but a little expensive, but could not use this as a reason not to award five stars as everything else was so good.More",5
4,Honest Review,"Polite and Professional
Clean and Pleasant
Steak was chewy and tough which was a disappointment as we were in a top restaurant. 
Although it was part of a deal I do feel that part of a staple menu should include potatos of sorts and at...least one veg before charging for extra sides. 
We were offered water still or sparkling which we had to pay for. 
I think I would have rather had sides and water instead of the cocktails which were included in the price .  It cost us a further ¬£48 which was for 2 x fries , 1 x onion rings, upgrade to a rib eye & water. 
Excessive I felt .
Be very careful when booking deals !! Read all the small print and know what you are getting otherwise a budget evening will exceed your carefully worked out budget and put a damper on the evening .‚òπMore",3
